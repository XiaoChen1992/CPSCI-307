# CPSCI-307

**WELCOME!!!**

This is home page for Hamilton College CPSCI-307 Topics in Computer Science II: Deep Learning. Be sure you ***READ THIS PAGE CAREFULLY!!!***

# Office Hours

MWF 3:30PM-4:30PM or appointment by email. You can meet me in person or zoom. 

Usually I will reply your email no later than 48 hours, if you do not receive the reply, email me again.

# Learning objectives

In this class, we will focus on applying deep learning technoigy on the real world data. After this class, you shoud be able to:

1. Covert a real-life or research question into computer science way

2. Build a deep learing pipeline to solve the question

3. Evaluate your deep learning model's performance

# Prerequisites

1. You should be comfortable to use python for programming or you are familar with other programming languages and can learn python in a short time.

2. Some basic linear algebra backgroud (vector, matrix, matrix operation, etc) are required

# Cousrse Materials

## Textbook

We will use [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/) as our main text book [(PDF download](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.11342#page=25.12)). Also, some classic machine/deep learning papers will also be included in readling list as home works.

The following two books are also worth to read if you want to discover more math behind machine learning and deep learning.

1. [Deep Learning ](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

2. [ESL](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/)

## Online resourses

Some high quality machine learning and deep learning online classes if you want to discvoer more areas.

1. [CS229](https://cs229.stanford.edu/)

2. [CS231n](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/)

3. [CS224w](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/)

4. [CS224n](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)

## Enviroment setting

We will use [PyTorch ](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) (version: Stable 2.3.1) for all assignments and projects. This class requires GPU for deep learning model training. You need to prepare your own GPU for class. Usually, NVIDIA GPU is default for training. But you also can choose AMD or Apple M chip for traning. However, AMD and Apple GPU may bring some unexpeted warnings or errors which need you to debug by yourself. 

If you do not have a GPU, some online platform can be considered. Here are some GPU notebook options. 

1. Google Colab

2. Amazon  SeageMake

3. Kaggle GPU 

If you want to train more complcaited model, you always can choose build cloud machine for use, but this is not required for this class.

# Academic Integrity & Collaboration

You should work on your all your homeworks by yourself. You can discuss your homework with me, your classmates, or your firends, but you are **NOT** allowed to use other's code or any code from internet. 

You can work on your final project on your own or team up to 4 students. If you team work on the final project, report each member's contribution on final report.

## AI policy

You are **NOT** allowed to use any kind of generative AI tools for your homeworks.Any code from generative AI tools or internet will be consider as cheating. You are **ENCOURAGED** to use AI tools for your final project.

# Grading

Your grade will be comprised of the following weighted components:

1. **Assignments(40%):** We will have 4 assignments, you have **two** weeks for each assignment. Each assignment contributs 10% of your final grade.

2. **Midterms (10%):** We will only have one exam before Thanksgiving. The exam's goal is make sure you understand the basic conpet of machine learing and deep learning.

3. **Project (50%):** The final project covers:
   
   1. Proposal (5%): Expalin your paln for your project, maximum 2 pages.
   
   2. Code and performance (25%): You code shoud be well orgnized and your model should have a resonable performance. What is resonable? We will learn it in class.
   
   3. Presentation (10%):  Each group needs to present your project. maximum 10 mins. 
   
   4. Project report (10%): Report shouid follow [IEEE format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html), maxiumum 8 pages (includes reference). The report covers following parts:
      
      1. Abstract
      
      2. Introduction
      
      3. Method and materials
      
      4. Performance
      
      5. Conclusion.

# Tips for success

If want to learning this class well, here are some suggestions

1. Read high quality code and learning how they orgnized their code

2. Design your deep learing model pipeline carefully
