# CPSCI-307

**WELCOME!!!**

This is home page for Hamilton College CPSCI-307 Topics in Computer Science II: Deep Learning. Be sure you ***READ THIS PAGE CAREFULLY!!!***

# Office Hours

MWF 3:30PM-4:30PM or appointment by email. You can meet me in person or zoom. 

Usually I will reply your email no later than 48 hours, if you do not receive the reply, email me again.

# Learning objectives

In this class, we will focus on applying deep learning technoigy on the real world data. After this class, you shoud be able to:

1. Covert a real-life or research question into computer science way

2. Build a deep learing pipeline to solve the question

3. Evaluate your deep learning model's performance

# Cousrse Materials

## Text book

We will use [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/) as our main text book [(PDF download](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.11342#page=25.12)). Also, some classic machine/deep learning papers will also be included in readling list as home works.



The following two books are also worth to read if you want to discover more math behind machine learning and deep learning.

1. [Deep Learning ](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

2. [ESL](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/)



## Online resourse

Some high quality machine learning and deep learning online classes

1. [CS229](https://cs229.stanford.edu/)

2. [CS231n](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/)

3. [CS224w]([CS224W | Home](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/))

4. [CS224n](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)



## Enviroment setting

We will use [PyTorch ](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) (version: Stable 2.3.1) for all assignments and projects. This class requires GPU for deep learning model training. You need to prepare your own GPU for class. Usually, NVIDIA GPU is default for training. But you also can choose AMD or Apple M chip for traning. However, AMD and Apple GPU may bring some unexpeted warnings or errors which need you to debug by yourself. 

If you do not have GPU, some online platform can be considered. Here are some GPU notebook options, feel free to choose anyone fits you best. 

1. Google Colab

2. Amazon  SeageMake

3. Kaggle GPU 

If you want to train more complcaited model, you always can choose build cloud machine for use, but this is not required for this class.

# Tips for success

If want to learning this class well, here are some suggestions

1. Read high quality code and learning how they orgnized their code

2. Design your deep learing model pipeline carefully
