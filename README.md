## Learning Objectives

In this class, we will focus on applying deep learning technology to real-world data. After this class, you should be able to:

1. Convert a real-life or research question into a computer science problem.
2. Build a deep learning pipeline to solve the problem.
3. Evaluate the performance of your deep learning model.

## Prerequisites

1. You should be comfortable using Python for programming or be familiar with other programming languages and can learn Python quickly.
2. A basic background in linear algebra (vectors, matrices, matrix operations, etc.) is required.

## Course Materials

### Textbook

We will use [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/) as our main textbook. You can [download the PDF here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.11342#page=25.12). Additionally, some classic machine learning and deep learning papers will be included in the reading list as homework assignments.

The following two books are also worth reading if you want to explore more of the math behind machine learning and deep learning. Both books require a solid statistics background. Let AI help you understand these two books:

1. [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
2. [ESL (The Elements of Statistical Learning)](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/)

### Online Resources

Here are some high-quality machine learning and deep learning online classes if you want to explore more areas:

1. Deep Learning: [CS229](https://cs229.stanford.edu/)
2. Computer Vision: [CS231n](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/)
3. NLP: [CS224n](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)
4. Graph Neural Network: [CS224w](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/)

### Environment Setup

We will use [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) (version: Stable 2.3.1) for all assignments and projects. This class requires a GPU for deep learning model training. You need to have access to a GPU for the class. Usually, an NVIDIA GPU is the default for training. However, you can also use AMD or Apple M chips, though they may bring unexpected warnings or errors that you will need to debug.

If you do not have a GPU, some online platforms can be considered. Here are some GPU notebook options:

1. Google Colab
2. Amazon SageMaker
3. Kaggle GPU

If you want to train more complicated models, you can choose to build a cloud machine for use, but this is not required for this class.

## Academic Integrity & Collaboration

You should complete all your homework assignments independently. You can discuss your homework with me, your classmates, or your friends, but you are **NOT** allowed to use others' code or any code from the internet.

You can work on your final project on your own or in teams of up to 4 students. If you choose to work in a team, report each member's contribution in the final report.

### AI Policy

You are **NOT** allowed to use any kind of generative AI tools for your homework assignments. Any code from generative AI tools or the internet will be considered cheating. You are **ENCOURAGED** to use AI tools for your final project, but you need to submit the prompt history (PDF file) to me.

## Grading

Your grade will be comprised of the following components:

1. **Assignments (40%)**: There will be 4 assignments, with **two** weeks for each. Each assignment contributes 10% to your final grade.
2. **Midterm (10%)**: There will be one in-person exam before Thanksgiving. The goal of the exam is to ensure you understand the basic concepts of machine learning and deep learning.
3. **Project (50%)**: The final project includes:
   1. **Proposal (5%)**: Explain your plan for your project, maximum 2 pages.
   2. **Code and Performance (25%)**: Your code should be well-organized, and your model should have reasonable performance. What is reasonable? We will learn in class.
   3. **Presentation (10%)**: Each group needs to present their project, maximum 10 minutes.
   4. **Project Report (10%)**: The report should follow the [IEEE format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html), maximum 8 pages (including references). The report should cover the following sections:
      1. Abstract
      2. Introduction
      3. Method and Materials
      4. Performance
      5. Conclusion

## Tips for Success

To succeed in this class, here are some suggestions:

1. Read high-quality code and learn how it is organized.
2. Design your deep learning model pipeline carefully.
